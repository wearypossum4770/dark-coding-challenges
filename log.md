# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: July 30, 2025

**Today's Progress**:  I was able to complete the challenge without using much AI assistance. Needed to find the arithmetic sum formula.

**Thoughts:** This one is easy, I wonder how combining the "Cycle Detection" algorithm with this would work.

### Day 1: August 7, 2025

**Today's Progress**:  Did the Merge Sorted Array challenge in Zig, and partially got Python completed. I will be doing two versions on this challenge one will be returning a new array and the other will be in-place. 

**Thoughts:** I will use a three-pointer technique to keep track of indices during iteration, Since the array sizes are known beforehand there should be no need to. My original thought was that this was going to be easy but it was not. I first attempted the challenge in python. Once I figured out that there was an issue with my logic, I used a little AI to help me look at the indexing issue, but specifically asked it not to solve the issue. Once I got a little way in I switched to Zig for this challenge. I needed to take a different approach. I did not want to attempt in-place mutations in Zig until I got more familiar and comfortable with the language. I put some notes on one of the test cases because I had to increase the first array/slice by one slot due to returning a new array from the function. If I was doing in-place mutations using the correct array size would work.

### Day 2: August 8, 2025

**Today's Progress**:   Did the challenge in Go Lang.

**Thoughts:** My metrics were not good, can look for optimization opportunities.

### Day 3: August 9, 2025

**Today's Progress**:  Implemented the algorithm in TS, Kotlin, and Java, to include the additional mutation version. 

**Thoughts:** The majority of the code has decent performance, could use some optimizations.

### Day 1: August 12, 2025

**Today's Progress**:  Implemented the Add Binary Challenge algorithm in TS. 

**Thoughts:** Since a day was skipped restarted at day 1.

### Day 2: August 13, 2025

**Today's Progress**:  Implemented the Add Binary Challenge algorithm in zig, python, kotlin, java and go. 

**Thoughts:** Not wanting to do it in swift, rust, or dart. Seems to be a bit more complicated in those.

### Day 3: August 15, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Completed the challenge in java. 

**Thoughts:** this challenge was easy.

### Day 4: August 16, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Completed the challenge in kotlin. 

**Thoughts:** this challenge was easy, just copied same technique from java. It is amazing how the different programming languages handle memory and how some users use a lot of memory. My code ran in 1ms while the longest took 2_098 ms. My code took approx 39MB of memory while the most memory was about 42MB.

### Day 5: August 17, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Completed the challenge in swift. 

**Thoughts:** Having issues with the testing for this swift keeps crashing. Not sure why or how to fix it..
