## 📝 Summary

Reverse the linked list in-place by modifying the `.next` pointers of each node.  
This is one of the most common and essential manipulations for interview prep.

🔁 **Approach**: Use a two-pointer or iterative strategy to traverse and reverse pointers.

### Algorithm Steps 🧩:
1. Start with `previous = null` and `current = head` (if language allows mutable parameters by default you can use `head` directly to potentially save space).
2. Loop through the list:
   - Store `next = current.next` (allocation inside the loop may increase runtime, outside the loop may increase memory).
   - Reverse the link: `current.next = previous`
   - Move forward: `previous = current`, `current = next`
3. Return `previous` as the new head.

## ♟️ Strategy

- 🔂 Iterative (Two-pointer)  
- 🔃 Recursive (Optional Extension)

## 🚨 Special Considerations

- Empty list -> return `null`.
- Single node list -> already reversed.
- Don’t create a new list or array — do it in-place.

## 🔒 Constraints

- List has up to 5 * 10⁴ nodes.
- Node values are integers.
- Must be done in-place with O(1) space.

## 🧪 Testing

✅ Empty list  
✅ One node  
✅ Even number of nodes  
✅ Odd number of nodes
